- display vertex numbers over vertices: this would really help with entering puzzles

- implement loading from files of:
    - grids
        - Note! We already have a LOT of polyhedra defined in slitherlink3D-old/js/polyhedra.js,
        thanks to Hart and Stemkowski.
        Data from the website "Virtual Polyhedra: The Encyclopedia of Polyhedra" by George W. Hart

        Converted to JSON by Lee Stemkoski. Which is probably much easier to work with.
    - puzzles
        - (with solutions)
- implement feedback on puzzles
    - detect when user has correct solution, and celebrate
    - choose and load next puzzle (let user do so when ready)
        - I like the idea of progressing: go thru Platonics, Archimedean solids, prisms & antiprisms,
                Johnson solids, Catalan solids, zonohedra...
            - more puzzles on the bigger polyhedra

- print out some 2D flattened charts (not nets) of octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron
    so I can play with puzzles

- graph theory regarding slitherlink circuits: see ideas/graph-cycles.txt.
