- integrate this repo with my existing one on GitHub, as well as the new Claude code,
    which I think is in the latter repo
- add public SSH key for github
- print out some 2D flattened charts (not nets) of octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron
    so I can play with puzzles

- graph theory regarding slitherlink circuits: see ideas/graph-cycles.txt.
