- How many Slitherlink paths exist on the edges of a cube? octahedron? arbitrary convex
polyhedron?
    - Remember a Slitherlink path is a circuit that extends across the edges and vertices of the graph,
        coming back to its beginning vertex, without ever intersecting itself.
        - A Hamiltonian circuit is a circuit that visits each vertex exactly once. We don't need to visit every vertex,
        or cross every edge. But we can't visit a vertex or edge twice. So a Hamiltonian circuit is sufficient but not
        necessary for a Slitherlink circuit.
        - It may be helpful to know that "Every platonic solid, considered as a graph, is Hamiltonian" [i.e. contains
            a Hamiltonian circuit]. IDK if that's true for Archimedean or Johnson solids. But it doesn't really matter,
            considering how we will generate our puzzles.
        - Hamiltonian_platonic_graphs.svg shows a Hamiltonian circuit, which may be puzzleable, for each of the Platonic
        solids. That could be very helpful for testing.
    - How many Slitherlink paths are unique up to rotation & reflection?
        - How many of those are "puzzleable?" That is, does there exist a set of clues that yields only one solution?
            This is a practical question, telling us whether certain polyhedra, such as small Johnson solids and prisms,
            are worth making puzzles on. If there's only one puzzleable path, it's not a shape we'll use much.

Specific polyhedra:
- Tetrahedron: 1 puzzleable circuit.
    - There is 1 Hamiltonian circuit, visiting all 4 vertices. But it is not puzzleable, because all faces would have the same clue "2",
    so you couldn't distinguish between rotations of the solution.
    - There is 1 non-Hamiltonian circuit, visiting 3 vertices. The clues would be 3, 1, 1, 1. This is puzzleable, but trivial.
- Cube: 2 puzzleable circuits.
    - 4 vertices: 1 circuit (around one face). Puzzleable.
    - 6 vertices: 2 circuits: book-shape (puzzleable), and zig-zag (not puzzleable). (Are there others?)
    - 8 vertices: 1 circuit, I think. Not puzzleable.
- Octahedron:
    - 3 vertices: 1 circuit (around one face). Puzzleable.
    - 4 vertices: 2 circuits, 1 puzzleable.
    - 5 vertices: at least 1 circuit, puzzleable...
        ...
    - 6 vertices: at least 2 circuits: zig-zag, puzzleable; twisted, puzzleable. I think. May be more...
