Ideas for types of polyhedra to use for Slitherlink puzzles.
All of these will be convex (unless otherwise noted).

- General criteria:
    - Aesthetically pleasing
    - interesting variety
    - fairly "round" faces, as opposed to very long, narrow faces, which are difficult to show clues on or
    click on the edges of cleanly.
    - fairly uniformly sized faces, for the same reason as above: We don't want huge
    faces and tiny faces mixed, beyond a certain point.
    - enough faces/vertices/edges to make an interesting puzzle.
    - not so many f/v/e that it's overwhelming to think about.
    - fairly "spherical" (i.e. uniform distance from the center) shapes are preferred
    as easier to work with.
        - but some "exotic" shapes would be fun too, for variety. E.g. Johnson solids.
    - I don't know a technical reason why the polyhedra must be convex; the puzzle should be
     basically geometry-agnostic (only topology matters). But any significant
    concavity would make it hard to see or select the needed edges. Personally I don't like
    the stellated polyhedra much. But I'm open to changing my opinion on that.
    For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellation#/media/File:First_stellation_of_icosahedron.svg
    wouldn't be too bad. We'd have to verify that the display and picking work correctly.
    - closed: I'm basically assuming all the shapes would be closed, but it wouldn't be
    impossible to include some "polyhedra" that had some faces removed. It would add interest,
    especially if we can see through the inside. We would have to make sure the opposite faces
    are visible from behind (less culling). And the puzzle generation code would have to make
    sure that no clues are placed on the removed faces.

Specific shapes & categories:

- Platonics, Archimedean solids, Johnson solids,
- near-miss Johnson solids; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-miss_Johnson_solid
    - e.g. expanded truncated icosahedron, with 3/4/5/6-gons!
        https://levskaya.github.io/polyhedronisme/?recipe=C1000aatI
- Catalan solids
- zonohedra
- prisms & antiprisms
- Goldberg (hex-based) polyhedra, beyond dodecahedron and truncated icosahedron.
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_polyhedron
    - including those with triangles or squares rather than pentagons
        See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamfer_(geometry)#Relation_to_Goldberg_polyhedra
    - Class I, II, III? I don't understand this system.
- geodesic polyhedra
- fullerenes
    - carbon nanotube - the ends could be 20-gons, but maybe smaller is better. 8-gon ends?
        The animation on Wikipedia shows a nanotube with each ring having 8 hexagons.
        What to do at the ends though, to make a closed shape? If we put 8-gons at the ends, we need
        little obtuse triangles to close the gaps. Or we do something more aesthetic with those gaps, but
        that would seem to change the character of a nanotube.
    - C70 (extended & twisted halves)
    - C26? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerene#Topology
- biomimetic shapes?
    - maybe something based on a (short) helical capsid? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid#Helical
    - something based on mineral crystals? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure
    - https://web.archive.org/web/20241209225850/https://polyhedr.com/polyhedra-in-nature-part-2.html
- Symmetohedra (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetrohedron)
- Parallelohedra https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelohedron
    - truncated octahedron in particular
- play with Polyhedronisme!
- generated stochastically, by randomly generating points on the surface of a sphere, then simulating
    repulsion & damping (and/or Hart's canonicalization algorith?).
    Could nickname this style "Volvox".
    I'm pretty sure I've written this code... need to find it. Look for "wooble" code.
    It may have gotten to the point of simulating the eventual placement of vertices, but not of organizing
    into edges and faces. One way to do that would be to use Delaunay triangulation, which I think
    I worked on ...
