    - including those with triangles or squares rather than pentagons
        See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamfer_(geometry)#Relation_to_Goldberg_polyhedra
    - Class I, II, III? I don't understand this system.
- geodesic polyhedra
- fullerenes
    - carbon nanotube - the ends could be 20-gons, but maybe smaller is better. 8-gon ends?
        The animation on Wikipedia shows a nanotube with each ring having 8 hexagons.
        What to do at the ends though, to make a closed shape? If we put 8-gons at the ends, we need
        little obtuse triangles to close the gaps. Or we do something more aesthetic with those gaps, but
        that would seem to change the character of a nanotube.
