# Slitherlink3D
Play slitherlink on a sphere, in your browser.

## Status
This project is in its beginning stages, and unplayable at the moment.

## Description
### Todo: convert links to markdown-style
I like Slitherlink puzzles, especially when <a href="http://krazydad.com/tablet/vslitherlink/?kind=penrose_lg_d2&volumeNumber=1&bookNumber=1&puzzleNumber=6">played on a variety of grids</a>.
But I'd like to go beyond the flat page and the planar grid, to playing on a topologically spherical grid, such as a <a href="http://www.georgehart.com/sculpture/roads-untaken.html">polyhedron</a>. For aesthetic reasons as much as anything.

I already have some <a href="http://levskaya.github.io/polyhedronisme/">polyhedral grids</a> set up, and some puzzles devised on them. This project aims to provide a GUI in which to display them and let the user interactively
solve them.

Three.js is used to provide the 3D display and input.
